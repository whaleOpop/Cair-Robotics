# Cair-Robotics
Cair Robotics is a gamification of robot development, that is, when a user plays, he uses programming skills to create a virtual working version of the robot.
Since real development requires a lot of resources, users can write the logic of their program in advance and transfer it to c++, which they can integrate into their boards.
